Never use any linux command or menu choice to change the screen size.

Instead, close all apps, drag the window corner to the size you want,
and then reboot.  If the current size is too big for the screen, you have to use the scroll
sliders on the rigth side and bottom of the screen to find the  "zero-one" power icon in
the lower right corner.  Click that and use the re-start option.

That always works, whereas other ways often leads to a system that will not
show the screen, and is either impossilbe or very hard to recover from.
