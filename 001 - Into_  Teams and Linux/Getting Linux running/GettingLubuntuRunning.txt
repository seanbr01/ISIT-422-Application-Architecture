To install on your home computer:
Go to this web site:    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
and download and install Virtual Box for your computer type.
After than is done, go to the same site and download and install its MATCHING version extensions,  VirtualBox Extension Pack.  Now you have a VM hosting environment at home.

Now for both home and the school computer, you need an operating system to install.

2020 fall version  (ISIT 422)

To get the Linux we are going to use, go here and download the VM image


https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hhvPnybcHNk3kdIYaaLQ_ezeO58MMY8-/view?usp=sharing




That is a huge file, like about 6 gigabytes, and will take a few minutes. It will likely show up in your Download folder as a xxxxxx.OVA file.
When it is done, just double click on it, and it will install itself onto your Virtual Box Host.

When it is done, start up the Virtual Box manager, click on the VM, and tell it to start.

Two super important things you must do to prevent corrupting your Linux and having
to start all over again:
1) DO NOT try and change the window size that this Linux starts out with using any linux tools or commands.
Instead, start it up, log in, then drag the lower right corner of the window to be bigger or smaller.  
When it is the size you want, go to the lower right  corner and find the 0/1 power button, click it,
and tell the system to restart.  Any other way of changing the window size may well make the 
system unusable.

2) Always shut down your Linux before leaving the class room or turning off your home
computer.

After you start it up, you can log into a pre-exiting account called bcuser
the password is the same bcuser (later, when you want to do privileged operations,
you will use a command called sudo, and it needs that same password).
