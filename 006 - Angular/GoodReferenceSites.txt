Is good, and covers things we need to know about an Angular client making calls to get data from a 
server,  but it relies on mlab mongo, which is gone … 
BUT: it also talks about CORS, which is an important concept we will have to come back to.

This article builds a working node server that knows how to talk to mongodb-atlas.
But that article does not use express to build a node.js server, instead it builds it up in steps, as needed. 
I like that, as it is more clear what a node server app really is made of. So it's a good read to better understand node. It also uses a good architectural layout of the code.
Also, the article does not use the node Router module, it just hard codes routes in app.js.  I did not like that.

Excellent site with detailed explanations of pretty much everything


Site we will work though, evolve to use mongo, and be your example application to help you code your course project
